Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.


# Poor practice 1
 The EC2 instance "Web Service Instance - C3" listens on all ports and are globally accessible.  Moreover, an Elastic IP address has been attahced to the instane "Web Service Instance - C3". As a result, the instance can be directly accessed from any where.

# Poor practice 2
InstanceRolePolicy-C3 has the access to all the resources. That allows one, who has access to the web app instance, to be able to access the secret recipe bucket.
